The selection process is highly dependent on the fit (in terms skills and interests) between you and the mentor, but here are some general criteria we consider:

Strong understanding of basics: We would like you to deeply understand the things that you have learned.  We welcome candidates of all levels, so it is definitely not necessary to know the latest work in AI or have taken CS229.  But if you have taken CS229, you should know logistic regression very well.
Passion and drive: Unlike classes, research is unstructured, open-ended, and relies heavily on intrinsic motivation.  Successful researchers are proactive about getting unstuck and just really want to make progress towards a goal without external pressure.
Curiosity: Research is about asking good questions, challenging assumptions, and asking why youâ€™re doing something, not just going through the motions.
Reliability: Like anything else in life, research projects have deadlines that need to be met, and clear communication is important (especially if you cannot meet a deadline).
